      <description>Selenium is an awesome tool that you can use to completely drive a web browser through a nice and simple python interface. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of cool possibilities to use this for red teaming, however the simplest is that it can provide a trivial vector for RCE when unauthenticated.
There are several publicly available exploits for Selenium Grid, however during testing I found that most of them were either low quality or do not work on unix environments due to the executable filesystem permission.</description>

      <title>Executing Code on Python Package Installs - Malicious Pypi</title>

      <description>Foreword Multiple researchers in the community have given dependency confusion and other supply chain attacks a bad name recently. While there are very valid reasons to perform this attack, please do not pollute pypi or any other package manager with typosquatting, stolen code, or other non-targetted attacks in the name of security research. It&amp;rsquo;s no different than spreading malware. The point has been made. Please be responsible.
Executing code on package install While most python packages are distributed as wheels, the &amp;ldquo;binary&amp;rdquo; distribution format, Pypi also enables developers to distribute their package as source distributions (or sdist).</description>
