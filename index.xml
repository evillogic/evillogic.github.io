Gone are the days of needing to buy an insane GPU rig, spend many to hours build it out, and have it be obsolete by the end of the year.
Unfortunately, the state of password cracking also hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed very much in many years. Hashcat is still the king, rainbow tables are still the most effective method of looking things up, and to my knowledge there are no projects that exist to make deployment, cracking, and infra termination all happen in a single step.</description></item><item><title>Proxmox Notes</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/proxmox-notes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/proxmox-notes/</guid><description>Collection of proxmox notes
MacOS virt-viewer (SPICE) Unfortunately it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like virt-viewer is supported by default for macos, so you have to use a 3P homebrew formula to get this working. The following gist was helpful in setup:
https://gist.github.com/tomdaley92/789688fc68e77477d468f7b9e59af51c
Note that you no-longer need to install the tap as the formula is in homebrew proper now.
I had to chown a folder of icons used by this formula, which is likely a shared dependency with some other program I installed as root.</description></item><item><title>Cheatsheet</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/cheatsheet/</guid><description>I think most people hate writing bash scripts.

In order to edit with Obsidian, I took some inspiration from this:
https://github.com/vinibaggio/obsblog-template
Where the basic idea is just to use Obsidian Git to push changes to the repository. No idea how well this works on mobile, and it seems to have the drawback that Obsidian still can&amp;rsquo;t edit .md files by default.
Obsidian Git&amp;rsquo;s documentation is useless.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Debugging</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/k8s-debugging/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/k8s-debugging/</guid><description>Print kubectl logs from deployment or scaled-job kubectl logs -l scaledjob.keda.sh/name=httpx-scaledjob --follow --max-log-requests 500 Creating an Ubuntu Pod cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: ubuntu labels: app: ubuntu spec: containers: - image: ubuntu command: - &amp;#34;sleep&amp;#34; - &amp;#34;604800&amp;#34; imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent name: ubuntu restartPolicy: Always EOF kubectl exec -it ubuntu -- /bin/bash

There&amp;rsquo;s lots of cool possibilities to use this for red teaming, however the simplest is that it can provide a trivial vector for RCE when unauthenticated.
There are several publicly available exploits for Selenium Grid, however during testing I found that most of them were either low quality or do not work on unix environments due to the executable filesystem permission.</description></item><item><title>Install Docker On Ubuntu or Pop</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 13:05:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/docker/</guid><description>Simple copy and paste to install docker on Ubuntu as of 9/12/22

If youâve recently tried to use Burp for Android versions Nougat or higher, youâll know that many apps have simply stopped functioning through Burp.
Most notably, apps like the play store complain about not having internet, even though you can connect to HTTP sites and probably get a cert error going to HTTPS sites, but it still works.
Even after you resolve these errors by installing your certificate in the system store, HTTPS still will not function due to Burpâs cert having an invalid length of time.</description></item><item><title>An LDAP Exfil Technique</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/posts/ldap-exfil/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/posts/ldap-exfil/</guid><description>Recently Iâve been looking a lot at data exfiltration techniques in general, especially techniques that allow you to bypass network access controls and escape from PCI environments.
I recently discovered a little trick that you can use to traverse network boundaries and obfuscate the source of your data via LDAP, which means that as long as the environment uses active directory and thereâs a device (such as a primary domain controller) that has the ability to cross network boundaries, you can leverage this technique to use any Windows box as a proxy between two boxes you control.</description></item><item><title>Windows Hardening Stuff</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/windows-hardening/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/windows-hardening/</guid><description>This is a random list of notes for Windows Hardening

For the record, Iâm not sure if this will work on a domain joined machine where conflicting policies may have been set. The AMSI script works by patching the AMSI DLL in memory, which means itâs not persistent and does not require privileges. The Defender command changes a registry value, which means it is persistend and it also requires privileges.</description></item><item><title>Mounting a Shared Folder in Kali and VMware Workstation/Player 2019</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/posts/vmware-shared-folder/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/posts/vmware-shared-folder/</guid><description>I hate that I have to write this, but a lot of the solutions out there are really old and misleading.

For a single file, all you have to do is:
takeown /F C:\FULL_PATH_TO_FILE
icacls C:\FULL_PATH_TO_FILE /grant Administrators:F
For an entire directory, itâs a bit longer:
takeown /F C:\FULL_PATH_TO_FOLDER
takeown /F C:\FULL_PATH_TO_FOLDER /r /d y
icacls C:\FULL_PATH_TO_FOLDER /grant Administrators:F
icacls C:\FULL_PATH_TO_FOLDER /grant Administrators:F /t
Basically, this can be used to modify and overwrite Windowsâs system files and other things youâre not supposed to touch. This can also be done from the GUI by assigning yourself to be the owner of the file, applying the change, closing the window, opening the permissions again, elevating to admin, and finally setting the permissions you would like.</description></item><item><title>Bypassing Windows Defender with the Windows Subsystem for Linux!</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/posts/subsystem-defender-bypass/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/posts/subsystem-defender-bypass/</guid><description>After watching BHISâs Sacred Cash Cow Tipping 2020 I was inspired to try out a few of the techniques BHIS demoed, and this is a pretty fun and odd one.
