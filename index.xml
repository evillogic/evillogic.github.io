MacOS virt-viewer (SPICE) Unfortunately it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like virt-viewer is supported by default for macos, so you have to use a 3P homebrew formula to get this working. The following gist was helpful in setup:

If you’ve recently tried to use Burp for Android versions Nougat or higher, you’ll know that many apps have simply stopped functioning through Burp.

I recently discovered a little trick that you can use to traverse network boundaries and obfuscate the source of your data via LDAP, which means that as long as the environment uses active directory and there’s a device (such as a primary domain controller) that has the ability to cross network boundaries, you can leverage this technique to use any Windows box as a proxy between two boxes you control.</description></item><item><title>Windows Hardening Stuff</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/windows-hardening/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/notes/windows-hardening/</guid><description>This is a random list of notes for Windows Hardening

For the record, I’m not sure if this will work on a domain joined machine where conflicting policies may have been set. The AMSI script works by patching the AMSI DLL in memory, which means it’s not persistent and does not require privileges.</description></item><item><title>Mounting a Shared Folder in Kali and VMware Workstation/Player 2019</title><link>https://blog.kazam.io/posts/vmware-shared-folder/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kazam.io/posts/vmware-shared-folder/</guid><description>I hate that I have to write this, but a lot of the solutions out there are really old and misleading.
